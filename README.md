Exercise 1 - Microservices Architecture and Monitoring

Your team is developing a microservices-based application running on a Kubernetes
cluster. You want to ensure efficient management and monitoring of the microservices.
#### Task
Design a microservices architecture for the application, containerize the microservices
using Docker, and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster. Implement monitoring
and logging using appropriate tools (such as Prometheus and Grafana) to ensure
visibility into the performance and health of the microservices.
#### Follow-up Meeting
During the follow-up meeting, walk through your microservices architecture,
demonstrate how the monitoring and logging system works, and discuss any
optimizations you made to improve the application's performance and reliability.
